## My process

Mobile-first workflow. Determined what Markup would be needed to style it for each screen size

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that if using positioning with responsive design, then many media queries are needed. I think there was an easier way to do this, wither with a change in the markup and then styles, and/or possiby grid.

### Continued development

I'd like to get better with Positioning, planning out the markup and css structure.
